Calculate Schlitter's Entropy with GROMACS

Unlock the hidden motion of your proteins! 
This bash script takes your molecular dynamics trajectory, fits it to a reference structure, and slices it into customizable time windows to compute covariance matrices and Schlitter entropies. 
Perfect for analyzing temperature-dependent protein flexibility and dynamics over long simulationsâ€”fast, automated, and ready to handle microsecond-scale trajectories.


ğŸ’¡ Features:

ğŸ”¹ Fit trajectories to remove rotational/translational motion
ğŸ”¹ Slice simulations into customizable windows for detailed analysis
ğŸ”¹ Compute covariance matrices and Schlitter entropy per window
ğŸ”¹ Overlapping or non-overlapping window support
ğŸ”¹ Clean, time-stamped output ready for plotting


ğŸ’¡ Outputs will be generated per time window:

ğŸ”¹eigenval_START_END.xvg â€“ eigenvalues
ğŸ”¹eigenvec_START_END.trr â€“ eigenvectors
ğŸ”¹avg_START_END.pdb â€“ average structure
ğŸ”¹entropy_START_END.log â€“ Schlitter entropy
