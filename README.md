Calculate Schlitter's Entropy with GROMACS

Unlock the hidden motion of your proteins! 
This bash script takes your molecular dynamics trajectory, fits it to a reference structure, and slices it into customizable time windows to compute covariance matrices and Schlitter entropies. 
Perfect for analyzing temperature-dependent protein flexibility and dynamics over long simulations—fast, automated, and ready to handle microsecond-scale trajectories.


💡 Features:

🔹 Fit trajectories to remove rotational/translational motion
🔹 Slice simulations into customizable windows for detailed analysis
🔹 Compute covariance matrices and Schlitter entropy per window
🔹 Overlapping or non-overlapping window support
🔹 Clean, time-stamped output ready for plotting


💡 Outputs will be generated per time window:

🔹eigenval_START_END.xvg – eigenvalues
🔹eigenvec_START_END.trr – eigenvectors
🔹avg_START_END.pdb – average structure
🔹entropy_START_END.log – Schlitter entropy
